even mature breeding stallions kept well away from other horses could live peacefully together in a herd setting if proper precautions were taken while the initial herd hierarchy was established<br/>Stallions follow the conformation and phenotype of their breed, but within that standard, the presence of hormones such as testosterone may give stallions a thicker, \"cresty\" neck, as well as a somewhat more muscular physique as compared to female horses, known as mares, and castrated males, called geldings<br/>Management of stallions usually follows one of the following models: confinement or \"isolation\" management, where the stallion is kept alone, or in management systems variously called \"natural\", \"herd\", or \"pasture\" management where the stallion is allowed to be with other horses<br/>In all cases, however, stallions have an inborn tendency to attempt to dominate both other horses and human handlers, and will be affected to some degree by proximity to other

protection from jellyfish, coral, sunburn and other hazards, many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation (often called a \"bodysuit\") even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments<br/>As early as July 1951, underwater hunters in Australia were experimenting with a natural rubber wetsuit \"of a 'wrap on' variety, which does not set out to be 100% waterproof (but it is claimed that) the leakage of water through it is so slow that body warmth under it is maintained for hours<br/>The difference between a wetsuit and a dry suit is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit, while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering, thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness<br/>The result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction, which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas, thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body (or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit<br/>After experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams, O'Neill

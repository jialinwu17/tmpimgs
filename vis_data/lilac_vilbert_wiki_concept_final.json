stop signs with no lights of its own, and oncoming traffic also has a flashing green, not a red stop-light<br/>In Ireland and the UK, a right arrow may sometimes be displayed alongside a green light to indicate that oncoming traffic has been stopped and that it is safe to turn right, however this does not necessarily mean that the turn is fully protected and road users should always check that there is no oncoming or approaching traffic before turning<br/>Layouts are typically simple: either the usual three-disc all-directions signal; the same with a separate green left or right \"filter\" arrow which lights up either independently of the main green (permitting a turn in that direction at an otherwise red light) or along with it (showing that conflicting traffic has been stopped so turning traffic does not need to yield (known as \"give way\" in the UK)); or using adjacent sets where the horizontal positioning and lane layout (particularly where lanes are segregated by kerbs or islands) denotes which directions are stopped or free to move<br/>In some areas, a \"prepare to stop\" sign with two alternately flashing yellow lights is installed in locations where a high-speed

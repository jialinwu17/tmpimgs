wirelessly data for telecommunications or computer networking<br/>According to Paul Horn, this has \"revolutionized our understanding of the capacity limits of wireless networks\" and \"demonstrated the astounding result that each user in a wireless network can access half of the spectrum without interference from other users, regardless of how many users are sharing the spectrum\"<br/>Wi-Fi is a wireless local area network that enables portable computing devices to connect easily with other devices, peripheries, and the Internet<br/>The wireless revolution began in the 1990s, with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution, and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology, including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones, mobile telephony, pagers, wireless computer networks, cellular networks, the wireless Internet, and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections", "sub pred answer": "wireless",

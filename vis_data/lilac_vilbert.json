that white light can be defined as a mixture of \"all colors\" or \"all visible wavelengths\"<br/>At about the same time that Goethe was publishing his theory, a British physicist, doctor and Egyptologist, Thomas Young (1773\u20131829), showed by experiments that it was not necessary to use all the colors of spectrum to create white light; it could be done by combining the light of just three colors; red, green, and blue<br/>Concluding that since \"all colors\" produce white light then white must be made up of \"all colors\" is a common logical error called affirming the consequent,

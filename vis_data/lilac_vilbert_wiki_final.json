formulation of urethane foam, many of the surfboards in common use have been of the shortboard variety between 180 to 210 cm (6 to 7 ft) in length with a pointed nose and a rounded or squarish tail, typically with three \"skegs\" (fins) but sometimes with two or as many as five<br/>One of the most recent modern advancements in surfboard technology is the creation of high performance boards which are wrapped in a stretchable soft skin which does not absorb water<br/>Surfers generally find a shortboard quick to maneuver compared with other types of surfboards, but because of a lack of flotation due to the smaller size, the shortboard is harder to catch waves with, often requiring steeper, larger and more powerful waves and very late takeoffs, where the surfer catches the wave at the critical moment before it breaks<br/>The funboard's design allows waves to be caught more easily than a shortboard, yet with a shape that makes it more maneuverable than a longboard; hence it is a popular type of surfboard, especially among beginners or those transitioning from longboarding to the more difficult shortboarding<br/>Some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard", "sub pred answer": "surfboard", "image_url":

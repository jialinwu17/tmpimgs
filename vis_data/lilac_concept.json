the shortboard is harder to catch waves with, often requiring steeper, larger and more powerful waves and very late takeoffs, where the surfer catches the wave at the critical moment before it breaks<br/>These boards displace more water and sit lower in the wave than a surfboard with a concave bottom<br/>Just as with the bow of a ship, the traditional surfboard fin creates a wave as it

of demographic growth, intensive grazing and industrial or legal causes), and at the root of the decrease of damage because of the transformation of a traditional land-management system based on overexploitation into a system based on land marginalization and reforestation, something that has happened mainly since the mid-20th century in mountain environments of developed
